<h2>Who will be running for president?!</h2>
<iframe width="580" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/82O4S1Cx0DU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I, Aniya Patterson am running for president as a Democrat. The other candidate's I will be<br> running against are Donald Trump(Republican) and Hillary Clinton(Democrat).</p>
<h3>Rules That I Will Enforce</h3>
<img src="images/6.jpg" alt="Presidental words"/>
<p>I will enforce many fair and loyal rules. One of them will be that I will provide lower taxes for the middle and lower classes. I would also lower prices. I believe that food prices and college prices are too high. The second thing I would enforce is to make the econemy better place. Such as the violence. I would mnake gun control more harder to get. I would also make sure that our Law Enforcement are doing their job right and keeping up with there records.</p>
<h3>Things That I Personally Believe In</h3>
<img src="images/10.jpg" alt="The Fist" width="500" height="370"
<p><br><br>I believe that we are all one. We can help each other out and to not be judge by the color of our skin. I also believe that we can stop the killing and the hatred of America by listening and talking about our problems instead of using weapons to do skin.</p>

<h3>Where The Other 2016 Presidential Candidates Stand on the Issues</h3>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T57HKiB0gsw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I do believe that it is  tough out there for a voterâ€”candidates from both parties have a lot to say<br> about countless topics. So I decided to put up a video so you can see where the other candidate's minds are at.</p>
<h3>Let's Stop World Hunger</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons why I wanted to be president is to end World Hunger. I want to start more and bigger orginizations to travel to those countries and give the chidldren the food they need like in America.</p>
<img src="images/WorldHungerHands.jpg" width="500" height="370"/>
<p><br> I would fly planes to Africa and all the other countries that need the food. Even me, myself will go to the other countries with my team. I beleive that World Hunger can be fixed.</p>

<h2>Vote for me</h2>
<img src="images/vote.jpg" width="500" height="370"/>
<p><br><br></p>I hope that you can see the way I want to change the world in these years that I will be president. Hope you can make the right choice and vote for me.</p>
